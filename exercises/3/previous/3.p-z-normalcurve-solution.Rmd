## Problem 1

Suppose that a test of sensitivity to cilantro's soapy taste is known to have a mean of 20, a standard deviation of 3, and to follow a normal curve. What percentage of people have scores *above* 24?

### Step 1: convert to a z-score

Use the value, mean and standard deviation to calculate the z-score for a test value of 24.

```{r}
z <- (24-20)/3
z
```

### Step 2: which area of the curve?

Consider which area of the curve you are trying to calculate. Let's visualize this a bit. The plot below produces a normally distributed curve with the mean and standard deviation specified in the problem. Add a vertical line to the value you are using using the `geom_vline()` geometry. Learn about this geometry and its arguments with `?`. 

Q1. Do you want to cover the portion of the curve to the right or to the left of this line?
Hint: You are looking for the probability of getting a score greater than 24. 


* Right - since we are looking for the probability of obtaining a score that is greater, we want everything above or greater than our score of interest* 

```{r}
ggplot(data = data.frame(x = c(10, 30)), aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, n = 101, args = list(mean = 20, sd = 3))+
  geom_vline(xintercept = 24)
```
Q2. Make a rough estimate of the percentage of the curve that would fall in the direction you've selected in Q1.

*Maybe 10%? 15%? Roughly something in there*

### Step 3: Calculate the area that is in the tail given the z-score

Use `pnorm()` to calculate the probability cut point for your z-score. The help file for pnorm is kind of a lot, so it may not be very helpful for you, but you can refer to lecture slides to format the function.

```{r}
pnorm(1.33, lower.tail = FALSE) # note that by default, pnorm assumes a normal curve 
```


Q3. Did the probability/percentage you came up with match with your expectations? If not, check your work - did you specify the correct tail and/or substract the resulting probability from 1 if needed?

*Note that if your p was roughly 0.90, you likely specified the wrong direction. You can check yourself by using the plot as a tool to set your expectations and double check your work*

## Problem 2

Let's reverse the direction of this problem. We are still using the same test of sensitivity to cilantro's soapy taste, which is still known to have a mean of 20, a standard deviation of 3, and to follow a normal curve. What raw test score would be needed to land in the top 75% of the distribution?


### Step 1: Find the probability value that represents the right cutpoint on the distribution

Use the image below to calculate roughly the point in the distribution where the data is separated into the top 75% of the distribution and its other portion.

Q1. Considering the cutpoint you selected, the normal distribution and the coverage of the standard deviations, in which z-scores range should you expect your Z-score to fall to cover the top 75%?

*To reason through this, you need to add up the percentages of the curve that are covered with each sd. At the mean or z = 0, you are at the 50th centile. At mean + 1sd or z = 1, you are at the 84th centile. So z for the 75th centile should fall between 0 and 1, maybe somewhere around z = 0.7*

### Step 2: Calculate the Z-score that corresponds to the probability threshold

Use `qnorm()` for this. This function works much the same as `pnorm()` but takes a probability and returns a z-score.

```{r}
qnorm(0.75) # this is the reverse of pnorm - we feed a probability and get back a z-score!

# using pnorm on the result of the above operation returns us our original centile of interest
pnorm(0.674498)
```

Q2. Did the z-score fall in the range you anticipated it to? If not, check your probability value.

*yup! and we estimated pretty close!*

### Step 3: Solve the z-score equation 

Now that you have the z-score, and you already know the mean and the standard deviation of the distribution, use the z-score equation to solve for the raw score needed to attain that z-score.

Again, the z-score formula is: z = (X-mean)/sd

*starting by filling in the formula  -- 0.67 = (x - 20)/4, simplified to x = 0.67 x 4 + 20*

```{r}
# reminder you're still looking for the score needed to score at or above 75% of the distribution

x <- 0.67 * 4 + 20
x  

```

Q3. What score is needed on the test in order to fall into the top 75% of the distribution?

* The score needed is 22.68 *
