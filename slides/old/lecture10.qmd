## Looking ahead

Due this week: Assignment 5 and Pre-registration

<br> Next week: Dimensionality reduction (no assignment due)

<br> In two weeks: on your own survival analysis and intro to GLMMs + submit assignment 6

<br> May 1st: TBD

## What is power?

<br> *Power* is the probability of detecting an effect given that the effect is in fact there

<br> You can also think of it as the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it false

## What is power?

In a study of a drug we know to be effective in reducing cholesterol, we compare cholesterol measurements in a group taking the drug and a group taking a placebo

. . .

With power of 0.80, we would correctly reject the null in 80% of the studies we did

. . .

Note that this also means that 20% of the time, we would not detect an effect

## Power in statistics

Two different reasons to analyze power in statistics:

1.  To estimate sample size needed for a planned analysis
2.  To check how much power a certain analysis had/ will have

## Power analysis for sample size

<br> Very useful at the research planning stage:

<br> Knowing the size of the effect that we anticipate detecting or would like to detect, how many individuals or subject do we need to sample to have adequate power?

## Power analysis for power

<br>Can also be useful at the research planning stage, but less common:

<br>If there is a limit on participant recruitment (budget, time, available pool) and given the effect size we anticipate finding, do we have sufficient enough power to invest in this study?

## How is power calculated?

Four concepts inter-relate:

1.  Power (1 - $\beta$, likelihood of type 2 error)
2.  Effect size
3.  Sample size
4.  Alpha ($\alpha$, likelihood of type 1 error)

. . .

If you know three, you can calculate the fourth

## Power and effect size

*Effect size* is a standardized measure of the strength of the relationship between two variables, or of differences between two means of groups

<br> Essentially take the difference between means of groups, standardized by the variation in the samples

<br> The larger the effect size, the smaller the n needed to detect it at the same power

## Effect size

Tell you how much of the variance in the data is expressed by your condition of interest

## Effect size and statistical significance

You can have a large effect size and small statistical significance (low sample size), or a small effect size and a statistical significance (high sample size)

![](images/p_vs_d_comic.png)

## Power and effect size

There are many ways to calculate effect size, and the methods vary across the different types of analyses, eg:

T-tests: Cohen's d, Hedge's g, Glass' delta 

ANOVA: eta and omega squared family 

Corr/reg: r, r squared, Spearman's rho Log reg: OR

<br> That makes power analysis fairly complicated

## Effect sizes for sample size calculation

::: incremental
In a power analysis, two main ways to set effect size:

1.  Gather data from preliminary work or published studies to gather effect sizes
2.  Make a guess of anticipated effect size - small, medium, or large
:::

## Power and sample size

Sample size is not linearly related to power - past a certain point, adding more power requires dramatic increases in sample size

## Power analysis for one sample t-tests

::: incremental
Steps:

1.  Determine means under H~0~ and H~1~
2.  Determine anticipated effect size (calculation needed here!) and desired power
3.  Determine one or two-tailed direction of interest
4.  Calculate sample size

## Power analysis for one sample t-tests

We have a vector of test scores for biology students taking Biological Anthropology and want to test whether they differ from the average score for all students, which is 85.

. . .

1.  Determine means under H~0~ and H~1~

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
bio <- rnorm(15, mean = 90, sd = 5) # 
mean(bio)
```

## Power analysis for one sample t-tests

We have a vector of test scores for biology students taking Biological Anthropology and want to test whether they differ from the average score for all students, which is 85.

. . .

2.  Determine anticipated effect size

```{r}
library(lsr)
D <- cohensD(bio, mu = 85)
D
```

## Power analysis for one sample t-tests

We have a vector of test scores for biology students taking Biological Anthropology and want to test whether they differ from the average score for all students, which is 85.

. . .

3.  Determine one or two-tailed direction of interest
4.  Calculate sample size
. . .

```{r}
library(pwr)
pwr.t.test(d = D, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.80, type = "one.sample", alternative = "two.sided")
```

## Calculating Power

We can check how much power we lose/gain by not adding more individuals

## Power analysis for two sample t-tests

We are planning a study of two groups of babies, one whose mothers experienced food insufficiency during pregnancy and the other whose mothers did not. We want to know if this impacts growth at the age of 3 months.

. . .

1.  Determine means under H~0~ and H~1~

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
insuff <- rnorm(100, mean = 57, sd = 5) 
noinsuff <- rnorm(100, mean = 60, sd = 5)
vecmean <- c(mean(insuff), mean(noinsuff))
vecmean
```

## Power analysis for two sample t-tests

We are planning a study of two groups of babies, one whose mothers experienced food insufficiency during pregnancy and the other whose mothers did not. We want to know if this impacts growth at the age of 3 months.

. . .

2.  Determine anticipated effect size

```{r}
D <- cohensD(insuff, noinsuff)
D
```

## Note for cases when no raw data is available

Often, raw data is not available from papers. You can get the information you need to calculate D if you have means and standard deviations from each group:

$D = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{SD_p}$

$SD_p = \sqrt{\frac{SD_1^2 + SD_2^2}{2}}$

## Note for cases when no raw data is available

```{r}
mean1 <- mean(insuff)
mean2 <- mean(noinsuff)
sd1 <- sd(insuff)
sd2 <- sd(noinsuff)

sd_p <- sqrt(((sd1^2+sd2^2)/2))
d <- abs((mean1 - mean2)/sd_p)
d

```
